# Javascript Design Patterns

Every developer strives to write maintainable, readable, and reusable code. Code structuring becomes more important as applications become larger. Design patterns prove crucial to solving this challenge - providing an organization structure for common issues in a particular circumstance.

## Categories Of Design Pattern

Design patterns can be broken down into a number of different categories. In this section weâ€™ll review three of these categories and briefly mention a few examples of the patterns that fall into these categories before exploring specific ones in more detail.

### Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

Some of the patterns that fall under this category are: Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder.

### Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They also assist in recasting parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do.

In other words, Structural patterns are used for object makup.

Patterns that fall under this category include: Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy.

### Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.

Some behavioral patterns include: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor.
